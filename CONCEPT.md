# 21.gifts — Concept

> Peer-to-peer donation platform. Direct human-to-human giving over Bitcoin
> Lightning, with NOSTR as the invisible communication substrate.

**Status**: draft, in active iteration. Last revised 2026-09-20.

## Vision

Help people in difficult situations by enabling **direct gifts** from one human
to another — without any organizational middleman taking a cut, gatekeeping, or
politicizing the flow of help.

Bitcoin Lightning is the only payment rail. NOSTR is the only message rail.
Both are plumbing — the user just sees a website where they can ask for help
or send help.

## Convictions

21.gifts is built on three convictions. They are the reason 21.gifts
exists; the Core Principles below say how it is built.

### 1. Giving is a duty of every Christian

Giving is not an optional extra of Christian life. Jesus assumes it:
“When you give to the needy” (Matthew 6:2) — when, not if. Whoever
has material possessions, sees a brother or sister in need, and has
no pity on them does not have the love of God in them (1 John 3:17).
Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead
(James 2:17). To neglect the hungry, the
thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick, and the prisoner is to
neglect Christ himself (Matthew 25:31–46). “And do not forget to do
good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is
pleased” (Hebrews 13:16).

The measure is free — “each of you should give what you have decided
in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God
loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7). The New Testament sets
no rate. The tithe of the Law is never laid on the church; the duty
is to give, and the amount is between the giver and God.

Giving is not only money. A smile, time, a coat, a visit are gifts
too. 21.gifts is the path for the money gift: one person to another.

The signature verse of 21.gifts is Matthew 10:8: “Freely you have
received; freely give.”

### 2. Direct giving, with no middleman, is the best and most beautiful way to give

A gift that goes straight to the receiver’s own address is the short
path. Advantages:

- The whole gift arrives: 21.gifts takes no cut, charges no fee, and
  adds no program overhead.
- No charity, platform, or program sits between giver and receiver
  to skim, delay, or politicize the gift; the only party in the path
  is the wallet the receiver chose.
- Giver and receiver stay people to each other, not a case file and
  a campaign.
- Both keep their dignity: one asks, one gives, and they meet as
  people in the living room.
- 21.gifts never holds the receiver’s Bitcoin. If 21.gifts disappeared
  tomorrow, the Wallet of Satoshi addresses would keep working.
- Help moves at the speed of the payment, not of a committee.
- The giver can see the person who asked — not an abstract cause.

This is Core Principle 2 (Truly P2P) in practice on the receiving
side; the v1 sending-side compromise is documented under the
transitional model below.

### 3. Bitcoin is the most effective money available today

Bitcoin is the rail because it is the strongest money 21.gifts can
put in a person’s hand.

- **Censorship-resistant.** Bitcoin itself cannot be told to refuse a
  gift that the sender and receiver have agreed. Capital controls,
  frozen bank accounts, war, a closed branch — none of them can stop
  the network.
- **Permissionless.** No account application, no ID gate, no banking
  hours. A phone and a Wallet of Satoshi address are enough, also for
  people no bank will open a file for.
- **Borderless and always on.** One network, every country; nights,
  weekends, bank holidays, and crises included. An international gift
  does not wait on correspondent banks or a money-transfer shop: it is
  sent like an email and arrives as Bitcoin, not as a form.
- **Cheap and fast at human scale.** Lightning makes small gifts
  practical; an email-like address is enough to receive.
- **Hard cap.** 21 million, so inflation cannot quietly tax people
  who already have little.
- **Bearer money.** In a self-custodial wallet — Wallet of Satoshi
  offers one — nobody holds it for the receiver. 21.gifts never holds
  it in any case.

On the website we say “Bitcoin” and “Wallet of Satoshi”; Lightning,
LNURL, and keys are plumbing and stay out of sight.

The public version of these convictions is `/about` in the app, in
every catalog locale. This section is the full argument.

## Core Principles

1. **Non-profit** — the platform itself earns nothing beyond what it costs to operate
2. **Truly P2P** — funds flow donor → receiver directly; the platform never custodies money
3. **Open protocol** — anyone can build a client; the website is one reference implementation
4. **NOSTR-native, NOSTR-invisible** — every message in the UI is also a NOSTR event,
   visible in Damus/Amethyst/etc., but the user is never asked about keys or relays
5. **Self-sovereign keys** — Passkey + PRF derives the NOSTR key client-side; the
   server never sees raw key material
6. **Lightning Address mandatory** — receivers must have a LUD-16 address; the platform never custodies receiver funds
7. **English canon, localized visitor UI** — CONCEPT, identifiers, commits,
   handbook, and api payloads stay English. Visitor-facing app copy is
   localized (`en`, `de`, `es`, `fil`). Adding a fifth locale is out of scope
   unless Brand changes.
8. **Thin client, thick server** — the browser holds only what _must_ be
   client-side (keys, signing, wallet flow). Everything else — relay
   communication, indexing, discovery, LN-Address resolution, anti-abuse —
   lives in the backend API. The app bundle stays tiny.

## v1 Transitional Model (decided 2026-07-05)

v1 ships with a deliberately simplified account and custody model so the
platform can go live and be dogfooded. It deviates from Core Principle 2 on
the donor's **sending** side (custodial LNDHub spending) and from Core
Principle 5 for **all** v1 accounts (no client-side keys; each account's
NOSTR identity is custodial, held and used for signing server-side — see
"NOSTR in v1" below). Both deviations are transitional
and will be replaced by a non-custodial setup. Receiving stays non-custodial
(LUD-16 only, as before).

### Roles

One exclusive `account.role` per account. Initiator has the same rank as
moderator; founder stays strictly above. A higher rank can always do and
see everything a lower rank can; equal ranks can do the same things.
Permission text names the minimum rank only. Do not write "moderator or
initiator" or „Moderator oder Initiator“. New passkey accounts are
**Basis**.
`verified` is a moderator confirming this person in real life
(forum badge), not Lightning-Address proof. A **funding-program grant** is
independent of that role: moderators review living-room posts against the
three convictions (human decision). `basis` cannot apply. Spend pings and
spend invoices require an admitted grant or a trial on today's UTC day.
A **moderator** is proposed by
an existing moderator and confirmed by a **different** staff
member, or appointed directly by a founder. Those grants persist as trust
edges (`POST /trust/verify`, `POST /trust/propose-moderator`,
`POST /trust/confirm-moderator`, `POST /trust/reject-moderator`,
`POST /trust/appoint-moderator`).
`GET /trust-chain` requires a member Bearer session (any role) and returns
founder seeds; `?around=<id>` returns one hop of stored public edges with
at most one incoming edge per subject (no inferred links).
Operator `PATCH /debug/accounts/:id` can still set `role` and does not
write trust edges; `POST /debug/trust-edges` backfills stored edges and
`DELETE /debug/trust-edges` removes the latest stored `(subjectId, kind)`
row (`createdAt` desc, then `id` desc), both without changing `role`.

| Role      | Capabilities                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Becoming a **donor** is an upgrade available to every account, not a role of
its own (see below). The forum shows a tag only for Verified, Moderator,
Initiator, and Founder.

### Login: passkey only

- **Passkey (WebAuthn) is the only login method.** No email, no password, no
  LNURL-auth. The browser creates or asserts a discoverable credential; the
  api issues a bearer session immediately. Account identity is `account.id`.
- **Accepted trade-off**: if the user loses the passkey and any platform
  sync, the account is unrecoverable. LNURL-auth was removed (2026-08-24);
  leftover `account.linking_key` values are historical and cannot log in.
- WebAuthn RP ID is `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` (`21.gifts` / `dev.21.gifts`). Missing
  RP ID → passkey routes 500; the process still boots.
- **Operator provision / viewKey claim (2026-08-30):** `POST /debug/accounts`
  can create accounts with name + Lightning Address and no passkey. The
  public `viewKey` URL is the invite. `POST /auth/passkey/register/begin`
  with `{ "viewKey" }` binds a passkey to that row (name and address stay);
  living-room rules agreement remains a later `/me` step.

### Donor upgrade (custodial, v1 only)

Any account can additionally become a donor and spend money:

- Recurring paying uses an **external spend worker** with a
  `lightning.space` LNDHub wallet. This api does not store LNDHub
  credentials and does not pay.
- The api issues recipient BOLT11 invoices (`POST /invoices`) and verifies
  the payment preimage (`POST /invoices/proof`). A matching proof records
  the outbound gift for public `GET /gifts/stats`.
- This remains a v1 custody compromise (the worker can spend), documented
  because it contradicts the non-custodial target; that replacement retires
  it.

### Receiver address verification

A receiver's Lightning Address is entered free-form on sign-up (a wrong
address is self-punishing — gifts simply go elsewhere). Proof of control
sets `lightningAddressVerified` (not the forum role **Verified**) via
micro-payment: the api pays 1 sat (or the provider's `minSendable` if
higher, capped at 10 sat) with a one-time nonce in the LNURL-pay comment
(LUD-12; Wallet of Satoshi allows 255 characters); the user reads the nonce
from the wallet's transaction history and enters it in the app
(`POST /me/lightning-address/verification` + `…/confirm`). No LNDHub payer
is wired yet — start returns 503 until one is injected; the process still
boots. No LUD-21 dependency — WoS does not implement LNURL-verify.

### Recurring gifts (v1 feature)

Donors can configure fixed USD amounts to a list of recipients. This api
does not pay. Invoice HTTP (`POST /invoices` / `POST /invoices/proof`) is
unchanged: the api issues BOLT11 invoices (LNURL-pay to the recipient) and
verifies the payment preimage. A matching proof records the outbound gift
for public `GET /gifts/stats`. An external worker holds lightning.space
LNDHub credentials and pays **when the recipient posts a top-level forum
note** (ping from this api); **replies do not pay**. Payout semantics on
that worker are fail-closed: ambiguous outcomes quarantined as
"uncertain", balance preflight before the first payment, and a per-donor
cap. Recurring donor UI and an in-process scheduler are not HTTP yet. Do
not invent `/me/recurring`.

### NOSTR in v1

Passkey begin options request PRF so the client can derive a recovery phrase;
API authentication and Nostr custody do not use it, so v1 runs NOSTR **fully
custodially** (decided 2026-07-05, restated 2026-09-21, resolves Open Question #9): on sign-up the
api generates a NOSTR keypair for the account, stores the `nsec` encrypted at
rest, and signs that account's events server-side with the account's own key.
Every profile, campaign, and comment therefore appears on the public NOSTR
network under the user's own `npub` — attribution stays per-user, and
external clients (Damus, Amethyst, …) see ordinary per-identity events.
User-owned keys (Passkey + PRF → NIP-06) arrive with the non-custodial phase;
the custodial-to-user-owned migration path is the remaining open part of
Open Question #9.

## Architecture

### Identity & Keys

The full key flow, end-to-end:

```
WebAuthn Passkey (PRF extension)
        │
        ▼  prf.eval.first(SHA-256("21gifts-nostr-v1"))
   PRF output (32 bytes, deterministic from Secure Enclave)
        │
        ▼  HKDF-SHA256(salt="21gifts-seed-derivation", info="mnemonic-v1")
   128 bits of entropy
        │
        ▼  BIP-39
   12-word mnemonic
        │
        ▼  BIP-39 seed → BIP-32 master
   BIP-32 derivation at m/44'/1237'/0'/0/0   (NIP-06 path, 1237 = NOSTR slip-44)
        │
        ▼
   32-byte secp256k1 private key (NOSTR nsec)
        │
        ▼  schnorr_pubkey
   NOSTR npub
```

**Key design choices** — directly modeled after the zkCoins app passkey module:

- **PRF salt is cached** — `SHA-256("21gifts-nostr-v1")` computed once per session
  and reused so all PRF evaluations yield the same deterministic output
- **Domain-separated HKDF** — different `info` tags for different uses (mnemonic
  derivation, AES key derivation, future expansion). Same PRF output, different
  outputs by purpose.
- **Versioning** — `DERIVATION_VERSION = "v1"` stored alongside the credential.
  Future versions can derive in parallel for migration.
- **Hard-fail on missing PRF** — no silent fallback to a weaker scheme. If the
  authenticator doesn't expose PRF, the user is told to use a supported device.
- **Address in cleartext for the locked view** — public NOSTR pubkey stored
  unencrypted so the locked UI can display "this is your wallet" without
  requiring authentication.

**Why NIP-06 (BIP-39 mnemonic in the middle) instead of `PRF → HKDF → nsec` directly?**

- User-readable 12-word backup (familiar to anyone who has used a Bitcoin wallet)
- Cross-client compatibility — Damus, Amethyst, and all NOSTR clients that
  implement NIP-06 can import the same mnemonic and recover the same identity
- Future-proof — the same mnemonic can derive other keys (LN, BTC) later if the
  scope grows, without breaking the existing identity
- Matches the architecture of related projects in the same stack, minimizing
  mental overhead

**Recovery paths**:

1. Platform Passkey sync — iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, 1Password,
   Bitwarden, hardware authenticator with sync
2. Optional explicit 12-word backup, shown once on sign-up, never sent to the server

Putting the same account on a new phone does two things only: a new passkey
on that account, and the same 12-word backup. Mein Konto absichern is
optional. The account works without it. An owner who continues is told what
it does, then chooses two people. Both are required.
If a moderator verified the owner, that person is suggested as person 1 and
can be replaced. 21.gifts does not hold a share. Specified in
[`docs/social-recovery.md`](./docs/social-recovery.md). Not implemented.

**The server never holds the nsec.** All NOSTR signing happens in the browser.

### Browser support for WebAuthn PRF (as of 2026)

| Platform / Authenticator  | PRF Support              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| iOS / macOS Safari 18+    | ✅                       |
| Chrome on macOS/iOS       | ✅                       |
| Edge (Chromium)           | ✅                       |
| Android Chrome 132+       | ✅                       |
| 1Password 8+              | ✅                       |
| Bitwarden                 | ✅                       |
| YubiKey 5 (firmware 5.7+) | ✅                       |
| Firefox                   | partial — lagging behind |

Unsupported-tail handling is deferred with Open Question #1 to the
non-custodial phase (this table, like the rest of this section, is post-v1).

### Donations

- Receiver profile **must** include a Lightning Address (LUD-16)
- The api resolves and caches LUD-16 metadata server-side, with health checks
- Donor flow in the browser: click _Donate_ → app reads cached LN-Address from
  api → browser fetches LNURL-pay callback → invoice → pay (browser ↔ wallet
  provider directly, the api is not in the payment path)
- In this browser flow the api never sees the invoice, the amount, the payer,
  or the funds
- **v1 addition** (see "v1 Transitional Model"): recurring gifts are paid by
  an external spend worker via lightning.space LNDHub. This api only fetches
  the invoice and verifies the preimage — it is not in the LNDHub pay path.
  The browser flow above remains for guests and one-off gifts.
- Optional: **NIP-57 Zap receipts** published to NOSTR for transparent acknowledgements

### Communication

Every "message" the user writes in the UI is a NOSTR event. (v1 note: NOSTR
is fully custodial in v1 — the api holds one keypair per account and signs
events server-side with the account's own key, see "NOSTR in v1". The table
below applies to v1 for the surfaces v1 ships — profile metadata, campaign
post, public comment, and the custodial PN channel on `/conversations`.
Zap-receipt / leaderboard rows stay deferred, see MVP scope. The
client-side-signing flow beneath it is target state.)

| UI surface                            | NOSTR primitive                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Profile metadata (name, photo, story) | `kind:0` (NIP-01 metadata)                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Receiver profile / campaign post      | `kind:1` (text note), tagged with campaign metadata                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Public comment / encouragement        | top-level `kind:1` (frozen `t=bitcoin` / `t=21gifts` / `r=https://21.gifts`; no `e`/`p`/`q`; Damus-visible `#bitcoin #21gifts` in kind:1 **content**; pending fan-out is not reset to stamp hashtags or photo URLs) |
| Private message donor ↔ receiver      | `kind:14` (NIP-17 sealed DM, modern) or `kind:4` (legacy)                                                                                                                                                           |
| Donation acknowledgement              | `kind:9735` Zap receipt (when NIP-57 enabled)                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Flow** — the app does not talk to NOSTR relays directly. It talks to the
backend API, which acts as the user's edge to the network:

```
app  ──signed event──→  api  ──fan-out──→  relays (public NOSTR network)
                                          (Damus, Amethyst, etc. observe)

app  ←──indexed feed──  api  ←──subscribe──  relays
```

- The app signs every event client-side with the PRF-derived key
- The app POSTs the signed event to the api
- The api verifies the signature, applies anti-abuse filters, then fans out to
  the configured relay set
- For reading, the api maintains an indexed view aggregated from the relay set
  and exposes simple REST/GraphQL endpoints — the app fetches one paginated
  resource, not raw relay traffic
- Default relay set is configured server-side; users can opt into a "raw mode"
  later (deferred) where the app talks to relays directly with the same key
- Target-state private DMs pass through the api as opaque encrypted payloads
  (client-side nsec). v1 is custodial: the api unwraps NIP-17 / decrypts
  kind:4 with the account nsec for the `/conversations` PN channel.

### Public member forum (v1)

The `/messages` thread is a **forum / messenger group**, not a social-media
feed. Visitors read it top-to-bottom like a group chat: oldest notes at the
top, newest at the bottom, composer under the newest note. A new post is
inserted at the bottom. `GET /messages` still returns the latest 200 notes
newest-first so the window is "what is recent"; every client reverses that
array for display.

### Trust & Verification

**Protocol level**: completely open. Anyone publishes. Trust emerges from NOSTR
reputation (who follows / vouches for whom).

**Website level**: stricter, to protect donors from obvious scams:

- External NOSTR identities are shown only after a verified zap of at least
  1 sat on a 21.gifts forum note; the protocol stays open. This applies
  retroactively both ways — a reply stored before its author's first zap
  stays invisible until that zap is recorded, and becomes visible immediately
  once it is recorded.
- NIP-05 verification (optional, badged)
- Profile completeness (story, photo, LN-Address resolves successfully)
- Community vouching (other NOSTR identities sign off)
- No KYC, no government ID

(v1 note: NIP-05 badging and NOSTR-identity vouching are post-v1 — v1 NOSTR
identities are custodial, server-held. Proof of Lightning-Address control is
the account flag `lightningAddressVerified` via micro-payment nonce, see
"Receiver address verification". That flag is not the forum role **Verified**,
which means a moderator physically met the person (`account.role`,
via `POST /trust/verify` or an edge-less operator `PATCH /debug/accounts/:id`).)

The website is **not a gatekeeper** — it's a curator with transparent rules. If
a receiver doesn't meet website requirements, they can still use a different
client on the same protocol.

### Backend (`api`)

Central to the architecture from day one. Holds the project's canonical
documentation, schema, and protocol. The app is just one client of this api;
other clients (mobile apps, third-party reference implementations) can target
the same endpoints later.

**Responsibilities**:

- **NOSTR fan-out** — accept signed events from clients and verify their
  signatures (target state — in v1 events originate and are signed
  server-side, see the v1 additions below), publish to the configured relay
  set
- **NOSTR aggregation / indexing** — subscribe to relays, index events, expose
  paginated read endpoints for the app
- **LN-Address resolution + caching** — LUD-16 endpoints get cached server-side
  with health checks; the app fetches a single normalized response
- **Discovery** — recent campaigns, ordering, eventual categories / search
- **Anti-abuse signals** — rate-limiting, spam scoring, suspicious-pattern
  detection at the edge
- **v1 additions** (see "v1 Transitional Model"): passkey register/authenticate
  and sessions; spend-worker invoice HTTP (`POST /invoices`,
  `POST /invoices/proof`); receiver address verification via micro-payment
  nonce; custodial per-account NOSTR identities (`nsec` encrypted at rest)
  with server-side event signing

**Non-responsibilities** (stay client-side; target state — the v1 additions
above temporarily move key generation/custody and event signing server-side;
recurring paying stays in the external spend worker):

- Passkey ceremonies, PRF evaluation, key derivation
- Event signing (the api never sees the nsec)
- Guest Donate LNURL-pay flow (browser → wallet provider directly). Recurring
  spend-worker invoices are the exception (`POST /invoices`).
- Client-side decryption of NIP-17 sealed DMs (v1 custodial unwrap is on
  the api for `/conversations`)

The api lives in its own repository (`21gifts/api`) and is the **canonical
home for project-level documentation**, including this concept document. The
app repo (`21gifts/app`) only carries frontend-specific docs.

**Durability**: Durable Postgres writes are also appended to `db_change` with
`at` / `op` / `before` / `after`. Secret columns `token`, `challenge`,
`nostr_nsec_ciphertext`, `nonce`, and `view_key` are stored as SHA-256 hex in that JSON;
other columns including `name` stay plaintext.

### Storage (client-side)

> **Post-v1 target architecture** (like "Identity & Keys" above). The api
> never stores a mnemonic or PRF output. The v1 session is a server-issued
> token bound to `account.id` after passkey authentication. The client may
> hold a PRF-derived 12-word phrase in tab memory only.

IndexedDB, two object stores:

| Store         | Contents                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `credentials` | Passkey metadata (credential ID, derivation version, creation timestamp)                                                |
| `keystore`    | Encrypted secret material (encrypted mnemonic / encrypted nsec); plus the NOSTR `npub` in cleartext for the locked view |

Encryption: AES-GCM 256, with two key-derivation paths:

- **Passkey path** — HKDF-SHA256 from PRF output, salt `"21gifts-encryption"`, info `"aes-key-v1"`
- **Password path** — PBKDF2-SHA256 from user password, 100,000 iterations, 16-byte random salt persisted with the ciphertext

## MVP Scope (v1)

**In** — app:

- Sign-in via passkey (WebAuthn discoverable credential; session bound to
  `account.id`)
- Receiver profile UI: name, photo, story, Lightning Address (+
  `lightningAddressVerified` via micro-payment nonce; not the forum role
  Verified)
- Public campaign feed (rendered from api response)
- _Donate_ button → LNURL-pay (browser flow, works without an account)
- Recurring gifts: configure USD amounts per recipient (paid by the
  external spend worker when the recipient posts a top-level note, not
  on a daily timer; replies do not pay)
- Public comment composer (POST to api; signed server-side with the
  account's custodial key)
- Moderation actions on campaigns/comments (Moderator role)

**In** — api:

- Passkey endpoints: register/authenticate/replace begin and finish, session issuance; `POST /me/wallet-backup-seen`
- Spend-worker invoice HTTP: `POST /invoices` / `POST /invoices/proof`
  (paying and LNDHub stay in the external worker)
- Receiver address verification: micro-payment with one-time nonce in the
  LUD-12 comment
- Custodial NOSTR identities: per-account keypair generated on sign-up,
  `nsec` stored encrypted at rest, events signed server-side
- NOSTR fan-out to a default relay set
- Subscribe to relays + index `kind:0`, `kind:1` events
- Read endpoints: feed, profile, replies-to-event, recent campaigns
- LN-Address (LUD-16) resolution + cache + health check
- Basic anti-abuse: rate-limit per account, malformed-input rejection
- Moderation: hide/unhide content endpoints (Moderator role); staff POST
  /trust/verify, confirm-moderator, appoint-moderator write role + edge;
  POST /trust/propose-moderator writes the propose edge only; POST
  /trust/reject-moderator writes append-only `moderator_reject` (role
  unchanged); PATCH /debug/accounts/:id may still set role and does not
  write edges
- USD → sats conversion for recurring-gift amounts via an exchange-rate
  source (fail-closed on a missing or implausible rate; paying stays in
  the spend worker)
- Custodial PN channel on `GET/POST /conversations` (NIP-17 + kind:4;
  official platform account; `Account.isPlatform`; `moderator_group` is a
  closed HTTP group for moderators with no Nostr)
- Forum replies (`replyCount`, `GET /messages/:id/replies`) and public
  `GET /messages/:id`
- NIP-57 mint probe before linking a Lightning Address (`POST /me/lightning-address`
  and operator `POST /debug/accounts` unless `NIP57_PROBE=0`)

**Out, deferred:**

- Passkey + PRF → NOSTR identity (NIP-06) — moves to the non-custodial phase
- Client-side event signing (v1 signs server-side with custodial keys)
- Any second login method or account recovery (no email, no backup auth —
  accepted risk, see "v1 Transitional Model")
- Linking multiple LNURL-auth wallets to one account
- Non-custodial donor spending (replaces the v1 spend worker)
- Non-custodial client-side DMs (v1 ships a custodial PN channel on
  `/conversations`: NIP-17 + kind:4, official platform account;
  `moderator_group` is a closed HTTP group for moderators with
  no Nostr)
- NIP-57 Zap receipts / leaderboards
- NIP-05 verification badge
- Native mobile app
- Categories / filters / search
- Smart matching / recommendations
- Advanced anti-abuse (spam scoring, ML)
- Pinned relay
- "Raw mode" where the app talks to relays directly

## Open Questions

1. ~~PRF fallback — what happens if the user's browser doesn't support PRF?~~
   **Restated 2026-09-21**: v1 begin options request PRF so the client can
   derive a recovery phrase. Missing PRF aborts register before finish. API
   authentication still does not consume PRF; server-side Nostr keys stay
   custodial until the non-custodial phase.
2. **Verification rigor beyond the external-identity floor** — the website now
   shows an external NOSTR identity only after a verified zap of at least 1 sat,
   while the protocol remains open. Which additional reputation or
   platform-level checks, if any, belong above that fixed floor?
3. ~~Relay strategy — public relays only, or run a pinned relay for the
   platform?~~ **Resolved 2026-05-25**: 21.gifts uses the shared `nostr.space`
   relay (strfry) maintained as part of the wider NOSTR-space infrastructure.
   No relay operation is in 21.gifts' scope.
4. **Funding the platform** — hosting, domain, dev work need someone to pay.
   Options: rounding-up donations, optional tip on every flow, sponsor, founder
   funds. Must align with "non-profit" principle.
5. **Legal exposure** — gift law vs. fundraising law per jurisdiction. Liability
   if a receiver turns out to be a scammer? Clear "this is a gift, not a
   contract" disclaimers probably essential.
6. **Discovery UX** — how do donors find receivers? Random? Curated front page?
   Categories (medical, education, refugee, etc.)? Time-sensitive urgency?
7. **Anti-abuse** — scammers, fake stories, AI-generated profiles. How to
   detect without becoming a centralized gatekeeper?
8. **Sybil resistance** — one person, many profiles? NOSTR Web of Trust helps
   but isn't bulletproof.
9. ~~Platform-signed NOSTR events in v1 — one platform key for everything,
   or one derived key per account? How is authorship attributed?~~
   **Resolved 2026-07-05**: v1 NOSTR is fully custodial — one keypair per
   account, generated server-side on sign-up, `nsec` encrypted at rest,
   events signed with the account's own key, so public attribution is
   per-user. **Still open**: the migration path from custodial to user-owned
   keys in the non-custodial phase (key hand-over/export vs. fresh identity
   plus republish).

**Dependency philosophy**: stay minimal. Target ~12 runtime dependencies. The
app does UI plus — in the non-custodial phase — crypto + signing; everything
else (relay I/O, indexing, discovery, anti-abuse, LN-Address resolution) is
the api's job.

### Backend (`21gifts/api`) — central service

The workload is I/O-bound (HTTP, WebSocket, JSON) — not CPU-bound. The
language choice optimizes for iteration speed, dependency sharing with the
app, and operational simplicity.

**Quality bar**: 100% coverage on every function (lines, branches, functions,
statements). Unreachable defensive code is exempted via `v8 ignore` markers
with a one-line written reason — never to silence the gate. CI is red until
thresholds are met.

## Repositories

GitHub organization: **`21gifts`** (created 2026-05-25).

**Where docs live**:

- `21gifts/api` — `CONCEPT.md` (this file), `SPEC.md`, `FLOWS.md` (UI-journey
  sketch), future `ROADMAP.md`, protocol decisions, schema, architecture
  diagrams. The api is the brain of the system, so it owns the canonical
  project specification.
- `21gifts/app` — `README.md` (short, points at api repo for protocol),
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` (frontend-specific: dev setup, component conventions,
  styling, testing). Nothing protocol-level.

**Per-repo conventions**:

- `develop` is the default branch
- `main` is the production branch
- Feature branch → PR → merge to `develop`
- `main` is protected; updates flow via auto-generated Release PRs (`develop → staging`, then `staging → main`)
- Every repo has `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`
- Strict linting (Prettier + ESLint)
- No `console.log` in committed code
- Commit messages in English, concise, describe _what_ changed

---

## Brand

- **Domain**: `21.gifts` (secured 2026-05-25). The `21` is a Bitcoin
  reference (21M cap); `.gifts` semantically captures the intent — these are
  gifts, not donations, not transactions
- **Tone**: warm, direct, dignified. Not charity-speak ("the needy"; quoted
  Scripture excepted), not techbro-speak ("disrupting philanthropy"). People
  helping people, with the best money humans have ever had.
- **Origin**: 21.gifts comes from Christian faith. The three Convictions
  above are the foundation. The public copy is `/about` in the app: it
  states the convictions and quotes the verses. It does not explain who is
  welcome: no inclusion slogan, and no FAQ entry asking whether the project
  is Christian.
- **Signature verse**: Matthew 10:8 — "Freely you have received; freely
  give." It is the gift principle of the living-room rules (`/rules` in the
  app) in one line: a gift has no price. Shown quietly in the marketing
  footer; not on the hero.
- **Visual**: minimal, photo-driven, large typography. Receiver photos and
  stories are the hero. Tech is invisible. No cross, fish, or second typeface
  as brand marks; Bitcoin orange stays the accent.
- **Language**: English for CONCEPT, code, commits, handbook, and api
  payloads. Visitor-facing app copy is localized (en, de, es, fil).

  - `:beta` — built from `develop`, deployed to DEV
  - `:staging` — built from `staging`, deployed to staging
  - `:latest` — built from `main`, deployed to PRD. `:latest` is an independent rebuild from `main`, not a retag of `:staging`
- **One image, multiple environments** — for the app, build-time placeholders
  for `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are replaced at container start by an
  `entrypoint.sh` with runtime values; the api reads its config purely from
  environment variables at startup. Same image runs DEV and PRD without rebuild.

## CI / CD (per product repo)

Five GitHub Actions workflows, identical structure for `app` and `api`:

| Workflow               | Trigger                     | Action                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ci.yaml`              | PR, push to develop         | Lint + build + test (required for merge)                       |
| `deploy-dev.yaml`      | push to develop             | Docker build → push `:beta` → notify infra repo                |
| `deploy-staging.yaml`  | push to staging             | Docker build → push `:staging` → notify infra repo             |
| `deploy-prd.yaml`      | push to main                | Docker build → push `:latest` → notify infra repo              |
| `auto-release-pr.yaml` | push to develop or staging  | Auto-create release PR `develop → staging`, then `staging → main` |

**Pre-push local checks**:

- `app`: `npm run lint && npm run build && npm test`
- `api`: `bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run test:coverage && bun run build`

CI red is unacceptable; it's caught locally.

**Testing rule**: new code on the activated surface (features actually
shipped) must hit 100% line/branch/statement/function coverage. Feature-gated
code (behind a build-time flag or a server-side capability gate) is excluded —
gated code does not need coverage as long as the gate stays off in production
builds.

**Image-build → deploy hand-off**: the product repo's `deploy-*.yaml`
workflow pushes the image to Docker Hub and sends a `repository_dispatch`
event to a separate infrastructure repository (private, not part of this
project's scope). That repo handles the actual host-level deploy, secrets,
DNS, and reverse-proxy routing.

## Hosting & Operations

Three environments per service, mapped 1:1 to the branch model:

| Service | Env | Source branch | Image tag | Public URL         |
| ------- | --- | ------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| app     | DEV | `develop`     | `:beta`   | `dev.21.gifts`     |
| app     | PRD | `main`        | `:latest` | `21.gifts`         |
| api     | DEV | `develop`     | `:beta`   | `dev-api.21.gifts` |
| api     | PRD | `main`        | `:latest` | `api.21.gifts`     |
| app     | staging | `staging`     | `:staging` | `staging.21.gifts`     |
| api     | staging | `staging`     | `:staging` | `staging-api.21.gifts` |

`app.21.gifts` / `dev-app.21.gifts` remain transitional aliases for the app
container. `staging-app.21.gifts` redirects to the apex `staging.21.gifts`.
Passkey RP ID is the apex (`21.gifts` / `dev.21.gifts` / `staging.21.gifts`), not the
api hostname.

Subdomain convention: **dash, not dot** (e.g., `dev-api.21.gifts` rather than
`dev.api.21.gifts`). `staging.api.21.gifts` is not a name. This keeps every subdomain at exactly one level deep,
which sidesteps the multi-level wildcard certificate problem on Cloudflare.

Public routing: behind a reverse proxy / tunnel that terminates TLS and
forwards to the container's port. Specific host names, secret stores, monitoring
hooks, and deploy mechanics live in the operator's separate infrastructure
repository — they're intentionally not part of this project's scope.

Unique remains `(recipient, type, reply_id)`. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-12 parent-author-only reply notify.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2026-09-15 | In-app living-room notifications go to every account except the actor/payer. Web Push still goes only to bell subscribers (`push_subscription`). Missing `pushStore` no longer drops in-app rows when `auth` is set. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-14 in-app-only-via-subscription rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2026-09-16 | A zap that inserts a gift-reply fans out only `notifyZap` (one in-app row + one Web Push), not a second `forum_reply`. Gift-reply row still lands in the thread. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-14/15 dual fan-out for that path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2026-09-16 | Stored per-account `notificationLevel` (`all` / `active` / `mentions`). Fan-out filters in-app rows and Web Push by that level (`POST /me/notification-level`; default `all`). `GET /notifications` lists stored rows unfiltered, including `moderator_appointed`. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-15 every-account in-app notify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2026-09-20 | `GET /notifications` applies the owner's `notificationLevel` to stored rows (same `wantsNotification` rules as write-time fan-out). `unreadCount` is matching unread. `moderator_appointed` always stays. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-16 unfiltered GET list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2026-10-01 | Level mentions is only a reply or zap on the recipient's own note, or an @username mark for that recipient. A staff or platform actor does not satisfy mentions. moderator_appointed and moderator_proposal are unchanged. Supersedes the staff half of the 2026-09-16 and 2026-09-20 mentions rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2026-09-12 | Trust edges persist who verified whom and who proposed/confirmed/appointed a moderator. Public graph JSON is stored nodes+edges only (no synthetic links; `moderator_propose` is omitted). Staff `POST /trust/verify`, `confirm-moderator`, and `appoint-moderator` write role + edge; `POST /trust/propose-moderator` writes the propose edge only. Operator `POST /debug/trust-edges` backfills edges without changing `role`. `PATCH /debug/accounts/:id` still sets `role` only and does not write trust edges.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2026-09-13 | Public `GET /trust-chain` returns founder seeds only. `GET /trust-chain?around=<id>` returns that chain member plus one hop of stored public edges so a thousand-person chain is loaded by click, not dumped on first paint. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-12 GET form (stored graph, never a first-paint dump).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2026-09-16 | `GET /trust-chain` requires a member Bearer session (any role, including basis). Missing or invalid Bearer is 401 `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`. Neighborhood shape is unchanged: founder seeds on the bare GET; `?around=<id>` one hop of stored public edges (`moderator_propose` omitted). **Supersedes** the 2026-09-13 public GET form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2026-09-17 | Public Trust Chain credits the proposer, not the confirmer. Projected kinds are stored `verify` / `moderator_propose` (only once the subject is a `moderator`) / `moderator_appoint`. `moderator_confirm` is omitted. A pending propose (subject still `verified`) stays private and is not a hop neighbor. Operator DELETE /debug/trust-edges removes one stored (subjectId, kind) row without changing role. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-12 public-graph kinds (`moderator_propose` omitted) and the 2026-09-16 neighborhood kinds parenthetical.                                                                                                                    |
| 2026-09-17 | Public Trust Chain picks one incoming kind per subject: the oldest eligible sibling (`createdAt` then `id`). Eligible: `verify`, `moderator_appoint`, and `moderator_propose` only when the subject is a `moderator`. First contact wins; later appoint, confirm, or propose do not replace it. A pending propose (subject still `verified`) stays private. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-17 kind-priority projection (`moderator_propose` if moderator, else `verify`, else `moderator_appoint`).                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 2026-09-18 | External NOSTR identities become visible on the website only after a verified zap of at least 1 sat on a 21.gifts forum note; the protocol remains open. The zap creates an external gift-reply on an eligible top-level note and permanently entitles that pubkey's kind:1 replies. Staff hiding an external row blocks the pubkey and hides its other live rows. Public JSON marks these rows with `via: "nostr"` and never exposes the pubkey. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-11 rule that all unknown-pubkey replies are omitted.                                                                                                                                     |

| 2026-09-20 | Staff GET of a soft-hidden forum note returns who hid it and when. Hide retracts in-app notifications for the note and its direct children. `GET /notifications` drops leftover hidden `forum_post` / `forum_reply` rows (zap still checks only the parent because `replyId` is a receipt UUID).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

No in-app Notification rows; `GET /conversations` still omits `moderator_group`. **Supersedes** only the staff-room URL in the 2026-09-17 conversation-push row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Spend pings `{ address, kind: "moderator", groupMessageId }`; proof attaches that row. A missing or mismatched group reference never blocks the payout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2026-09-20 | Passkey authenticate/register finish and operator debug session mint refuse an account whose stored `sessionRefused` flag is true: HTTP 403 with the wrong-account error and no bearer. `GET /me` with an already-minted token for that row is the same 403 so the client can sign the visitor out. Other authenticated routes treat that token as missing (401). Operators set the flag with `PATCH /debug/accounts/:id`. The account row is not deleted. **Supersedes** the same-day listed-id copy of this row.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2026-09-20 | A paid moderator stipend in the closed Moderators group carries a durable `gift_for_message_id` / public `giftFor` link to the group message that triggered it, so the app can render the stipend row attached under that message.

Pending = latest propose/reject is propose, subject still verified, no confirm/appoint. Unique live kinds are verify/confirm/appoint only (propose/reject may repeat). An open proposal fans out in-app `moderator_proposal` plus Web Push to other staff until confirm/reject; mark-read does not dismiss it. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-17 pending-propose list row (pending was any propose without confirm/appoint).                                                     |

Fan-out filters in-app rows and Web Push by that level (`POST /me/notification-level`; default `all`). `GET /notifications` lists stored rows unfiltered, including `moderator_appointed`. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-15 every-account in-app notify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2026-09-20 | `GET /notifications` applies the owner's `notificationLevel` to stored rows (same `wantsNotification` rules as write-time fan-out). `unreadCount` is matching unread. `moderator_appointed` always stays. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-16 unfiltered GET list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Staff `POST /trust/verify`, `confirm-moderator`, and `appoint-moderator` write role + edge; `POST /trust/propose-moderator` writes the propose edge only. Operator `POST /debug/trust-edges` backfills edges without changing `role`. `PATCH /debug/accounts/:id` still sets `role` only and does not write trust edges.                                                                                                                                                   |

| 2026-09-16 | `GET /trust-chain` requires a member Bearer session (any role, including basis). Missing or invalid Bearer is 401 `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`. Neighborhood shape is unchanged: founder seeds on the bare GET; `?around=<id>` one hop of stored public edges (`moderator_propose` omitted). **Supersedes** the 2026-09-13 public GET form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2026-09-17 | Public Trust Chain credits the proposer, not the confirmer. Projected kinds are stored `verify` / `moderator_propose` (only once the subject is a `moderator`) / `moderator_appoint`. `moderator_confirm` is omitted. A pending propose (subject still `verified`) stays private and is not a hop neighbor. Operator DELETE /debug/trust-edges removes one stored (subjectId, kind) row without changing role. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-12 public-graph kinds (`moderator_propose` omitted) and the 2026-09-16 neighborhood kinds parenthetical.                                                                                                                    |
| 2026-09-17 | Public Trust Chain picks one incoming kind per subject: the oldest eligible sibling (`createdAt` then `id`). Eligible: `verify`, `moderator_appoint`, and `moderator_propose` only when the subject is a `moderator`. First contact wins; later appoint, confirm, or propose do not replace it. A pending propose (subject still `verified`) stays private. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-17 kind-priority projection (`moderator_propose` if moderator, else `verify`, else `moderator_appoint`).                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 2026-09-17 | Staff Bearer `GET /trust/proposals` lists pending `moderator_propose` (verified subject, no confirm/appoint).

| 2026-09-20 | Staff `DELETE /messages/:id` still only soft-hides on 21.gifts, then best-effort publishes NIP-09 `kind: 5` (author nsec, durability relay plus Damus/Primal/nos.lol, not gated on `NOSTR_PUBLISH*`) and purges cached public photo/video URLs at Cloudflare when `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` + `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` are set. Failure still 204. Debug restore does not undelete Nostr. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-12 “soft-hide remains a public-API filter only” note.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2026-09-20 | Staff GET of a soft-hidden forum note returns who hid it and when. Hide retracts in-app notifications for the note and its direct children. `GET /notifications` drops leftover hidden `forum_post` / `forum_reply` rows (zap still checks only the parent because `replyId` is a receipt UUID).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2026-09-20 | Official platform account (`isPlatform`) never fans out living-room `forum_post` / `forum_reply` / `zap` (in-app or Web Push). House daily gift-replies still persist. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-14/15/16 living-room fan-out for the platform actor only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2026-09-20 | Moderators-group Web Push (`type: conversation`) opens `/moderate/group` (the staff-room thread). Member DM push stays `/messages?c=<id>`; forum/zap stay `/notifications`. Tag remains `conversation:<id>`. No in-app Notification rows; `GET /conversations` still omits `moderator_group`. **Supersedes** only the staff-room URL in the 2026-09-17 conversation-push row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2026-09-20 | A paid moderator stipend appears in the closed Moderators group as a house ("21.gifts") message carrying the paid sats, after the triggering group message, at payment time. Spend pings `{ address, kind: "moderator", groupMessageId }`; proof attaches that row. A missing or mismatched group reference never blocks the payout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2026-09-20 | Passkey authenticate/register finish and operator debug session mint refuse an account whose stored `sessionRefused` flag is true: HTTP 403 with the wrong-account error and no bearer. `GET /me` with an already-minted token for that row is the same 403 so the client can sign the visitor out. Other authenticated routes treat that token as missing (401). Operators set the flag with `PATCH /debug/accounts/:id`. The account row is not deleted. **Supersedes** the same-day listed-id copy of this row.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2026-09-20 | A paid moderator stipend in the closed Moderators group carries a durable `gift_for_message_id` / public `giftFor` link to the group message that triggered it, so the app can render the stipend row attached under that message. Absent or null on every other conversation row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2026-09-21 | `GET /conversations` (and other public conversation list rows) include per-row `unreadMessageCount` (inbound messages strictly after last-read; `0` when none). `unread` stays `unreadMessageCount > 0`. Envelope `unreadCount` remains the number of listed unread threads (menu/PWA badge). Gift-only inbound counts; outbound does not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2026-09-20 | Staff may reject an open moderator proposal. Reject is append-only `moderator_reject` (role stays `verified`). Re-propose after reject inserts a new `moderator_propose` (history kept). Pending = latest propose/reject is propose, subject still verified, no confirm/appoint. Unique live kinds are verify/confirm/appoint only (propose/reject may repeat). An open proposal fans out in-app `moderator_proposal` plus Web Push to other staff until confirm, until reject when pending is then empty, or until appoint; mark-read does not dismiss it. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-17 pending-propose list row (pending was any propose without confirm/appoint). |
| 2026-09-21 | Optional `GET /messages?hashtag=` token filter on live top-level `text` (name without `#`; token match; combines with `mode`/`limit`/`cursor`). No new entity, table, or index. A shops page of 20 is 20 matching notes, not 20 mixed notes filtered later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2026-09-21 | Propose/confirm/reject re-list after insert so a concurrent older propose, a concurrent reject, or a concurrent confirm/appoint cannot leave two live outcomes. Confirm and reject compare the pending propose by edge id (same-actor same-ms re-propose is a different row). After propose notify, re-list and drop or refresh `moderator_proposal` rows when that insert is no longer pending. The public graph projects at most one incoming edge per subject (winning id), skipping non-chain oldest siblings. **Supersedes** the 2026-09-17 “one incoming kind” / first-contact-wins row.                                                                        |

| 2026-09-22 | A top-level forum note may store an optional place pin (latitude, longitude, label at most 80 characters). Replies cannot. Public JSON includes `place` only when set. `GET /messages/places` lists live top-level pins for a map.

## Next Steps

1. ~~Create `21gifts/api` repo skeleton~~ — done 2026-05-25: TS + Bun + Hono +
   Vitest, 100% coverage on `/healthz` and `/info`, this CONCEPT.md committed
   as the canonical home
2. ~~Create `21gifts/app` repo skeleton (Next.js 15 + TS strict + Tailwind +
   Zustand)~~ — done 2026-07-05: public repo exists
3. ~~Port the passkey + PRF + key-derivation primitives from the reference
   app~~ — restated 2026-09-21: v1 begin options request PRF for client
   phrase export; API auth and Nostr custody do not use it
4. ~~Define the v1 api surface (passkey login, donor wallets, recurring-gift
   scheduler, address verification, custodial NOSTR identities + server-side
   event signing, feed, LN-Address resolver) — `SPEC.md` in the api repo~~ —
   done 2026-08-15: implemented HTTP surface documented in `SPEC.md`;
   remaining CONCEPT capabilities listed there as not implemented
5. ~~Wire up the four CI/CD workflows on both repos and Docker Hub
   publishing~~ — done 2026-07-05: `ci`, `deploy-dev`, `deploy-prd`, and
   `auto-release-pr` exist on api and app
6. ~~Validate LNURL-auth end-to-end with real wallets~~ — cancelled 2026-08-24:
   LNURL-auth login was removed; login is passkey-only
7. ~~Sketch core UI flows: sign-in → profile → donate → recurring gifts → message~~ —
   done 2026-08-15: `FLOWS.md` sketches the five journeys and labels
   each Shipped vs Sketch; HTTP stays in `SPEC.md`
8. ~~Choose initial NOSTR relay set~~ — done 2026-05-25: shared `nostr.space` relay
   (see Decisions Log 2026-05-25 / Open Question #3)
9. ~~First public DEV deploy~~ — done 2026-07-05: public DEV URLs are live
   (`dev-api.21.gifts`, `dev-app.21.gifts`)
10. Iterate MVP, dogfood early
